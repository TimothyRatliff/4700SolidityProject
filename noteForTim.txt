Timothy,

You'll notice that there is a nice new directory inside of this one.
That is our nice new webApp testing zone. I haven't tested it yet, but it should
be to the point where you can migrate contracts and then run some tests. I left
some of the index files in there that came with the webpack as well as the ones
that Mohammed already gave us. Those will show you what all we need to import
etc. 

So we really just have to use those as templates for our code. Maybe even just
change the JS. and HTML to our liking. I know you're good with the web app side
of things. I'll get as much work done on the JS side that I can, but I have to
get some research stuff done.
